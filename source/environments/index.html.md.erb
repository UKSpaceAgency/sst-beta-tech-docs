# Environments

The following environments have been defined for the needs of the service during Beta.

## Development

The [Development environment](https://www.dev.monitor-your-satellites.service.gov.uk/) is where Monitor your Satellites is built.
It is where the majority time is spent by our Developers.
We have [Development API swagger docs](https://api.dev.monitor-your-satellites.service.gov.uk/docs) and [development environment deployment tracking](https://mys-deployment-history-dev-00b8a.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/index.html)

## Demo

The [Demo environment](https://demo.monitor-your-satellites.service.gov.uk/) is used as a staging environment between
Development and Production. It is used to Demonstrate upcoming functionality and during periods of intense development it
provides a test environment, which isn't subject to the downtime with every merge to the main branch by developers.
