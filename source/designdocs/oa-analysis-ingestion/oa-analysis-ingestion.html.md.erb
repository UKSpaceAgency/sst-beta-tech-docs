# UKSA Orbital Analyst analysis ingestion

## Purpose
This design document will propose a design for UKSA OA (orbital analyst) analysis ingestion.

##Context and scope
UKSA orbital analysts complete event analysis on conjunction events that crossed certain predefined thresholds (set by UKSA). OAs will need to submit their analysis when an event crosses these thresholds and/or if they receive ephemeris files from operators and decide to conduct additional analysis.

##Goals and non-goals

The goal of this design doc is to articulate a design for the ingestion of UKSA OA analysis into MmS.

### Goals

* OAs need to be able to share their analysis with users of MmS
* OA analysis must be uploaded and stored securely
* Validation mechanisms must be in place to ensure file is safe & valid
* OA analysis must be stored in a way that allows it to be monitored and audited
* Users of MmS need to know when the data that they are seeing is from OA analysis (and how and when this analysis was conducted - at MVP, MmS will provide standard text & at post-MVP OAs can add comments or operators can contact an analyst for more information)

### Non-Goals

* Case management system for OA conjunction analysis

##The actual design

###Data schema
The table below contains the data required from the OAs:

####Post-MVP data fields
- Miss distance uncertainties
- Comments field for OAs to add free text
- Ability to overwrite manoeuvrability and other object fields
- Ability to add sources of activeness and manoeuvrability data

###File upload
1. <b>OA will be able to upload a JSON file into MmS</b>
Via manual log-in or API (post-MVP)

* At MVP, this will involve a manual file upload via the web interface
* Post-MVP, we will integrate with the OA workbench tools via API

Constraints on file upload:
* File size
* Meets the defined schema
* Post MVP: when API integration, limit number of uploads per day

The file must have the following to be accepted:
* The file must have a JSON extension.
* The file must not exceed 12 MB.
* The file must match the defined schema for analysis.

The data schema for JSON files is as follows:

```
{
"event_id": " ",
"cdm_id": " ",
"collision_probability": ,
"tca": " ",
"miss_distance":
{
"total_value":,
"total_uncertainty":,
"mean_radial_value":,
"mean_radial_uncertainty":,
"in_track_value":,
"in_track_uncertainty": ,
"cross_track_value": ,
"cross_track_uncertainty":
},
"update_time": " ",
"altitude": ,
"latitude":,
"longitude":,
"relative_velocity": ,
"estimated_combined_mass": ,
"estimated_fragments": ,
"primary_object":
{
"norad_id": " ",
"data_received": " ",
"data_source": " ",
"HBR": ,
"observations_number": ,
"observations_available": ,
"observations_timespan": ,
"OD_Quality":
},
"secondary_object":
{
"norad_id": " ",
"data_received": " ",
"data_source": " ",
"HBR": ,
"observations_number": ,
"observations_available": ,
"observations_timespan": ,
"OD_Quality":
},
"collision_probability_method": " "
}
```

2.<b> OA receives instant validation that the file has been accepted & saved to database</b>
Operator and Government users receive an email from GOV.UK Notify saying the event has been updated.

Note, users will receive notifications for any analysis that is submitted by the UKSA OAs irrelevant of their thresholds.

3.<b> Contents of the file are extracted and integrated into MmS database event table.</b>

Analysis is input into the UKSA columns in the event summary table, the additional event information table & data sources table, for example:

![OA analysis ingestion](/designdocs/oa-analysis-ingestion/oa-analysis-ingestion.png "")

The generic sources of each table and field will be explained in the ‘data sources information’ page.

<b>Post-MVP:</b> users will be able to generate a .pdf report from the event information page or download the event data as a .csv file.<br>
<b>POST MVP:</b> A table of historic JSON file uploads will be shown. OAs will have the ability to delete a file using this table.

###Data Storage

OA analysis will be stored indefinitely against an event. Each update will be stored and shown in the event history table.
###Security considerations
1. Ensuring analysis file does not contain any viruses
  a. Virus checks
2. Ensuring analysis is valid
  a. File structure and schema is as expected/defined
3. Monitoring and logging OA activity
  a. OA activity will be logged to provide an audit trail
4. Analysis is classified as OFFICIAL
  a. User will see a warning message saying “do not share outside of your organisation”

###Degrees of constraint

##Alternatives considered
* API - direct API integration with OA workbench
  * Too difficult to implement in this time-frame
  * Integration with OA workbench is not future-proof as these tools may change in time
* Email - allow OAs to attach file to an email to MmS


##Cross-cutting concerns

* Bad actor concerns - a record needs to be kept of all JSON uploads.
