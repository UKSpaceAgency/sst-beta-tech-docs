# Object Data Ingestion

## Purpose
‘Monitor my Satellites’ needs to ingest object data to meet the user's needs. MmS requires data on both UK and non-UK objects involved in events. There are a range of sources available to retrieve data from and, therefore, we must evaluate how best to ingest object data to ensure we provide accurate and up-to-date information to our users.

##Context and scope

##Goals and non-goals

###Goals
*  To accurately, efficiently and securely provide satellite information to MmS users.
* Data fields required include:
  * Common Name
  * NORAD ID
  * International Designator
  * Object Type
  * Licensed by
  * Launching State
  * Launching Year
  * Active/inactive (post-MVP only)
    * Status (post-MVP only)
    * Source of activeness information (post-MVP only)
  * Maneuverability
    * Status
    * Source of manoeuvrability information (post-MVP only SATCAT/CDM for MVP)
  * Decay date (post-MVP)
  * Mass (kg) (post-MVP)
  * Source of mass data
  * Size (and/or hard body radius) (post-MVP)
  * Source of mass data
  * Operator
  * Inclination
  * Apogee
  * Perigee
  * Period
  * Comment field for Orbital Analysts (post-MVP)
* UK satellite data will need to be ingested when a satellite is licensed, and stored indefinitely
* All objects in US catalogue will be retrieved from SATCAT as often as possible and stored in MmS database indefinitely
* Post-MVP goals include:
  * Add comments fields in object data for OAs (POST MVP)
  * Allowing operators to edit their own object data (POST MVP)
  * Allowing OAs to update foreign objects in the event database (POST MVP)
  * Allowing OAs can search event database for objects (POST MVP)
  * PDF report generation (POST POST MVP)

##The actual design

###Ingesting current satellites and objects
1. Monitor my satellites’ Space Track permission is only to ingest UK objects, so there is no need to filter ingestion - all available CDMs and satellites can be ingested.
  a) NOTE do not use the COUNTRY field as inaccurate
  b) CDMs and satellites will be retrieved every ~2 hours
2. Outdated object data should be retained to ensure we have object data history

###Adding new satellites

As we only receive CDMs for satellites that are a) registered in Space-Track and b) linked to UKSpOC, there is no value in adding satellites to MmS before this happens. Therefore, we will retrieve satellite information every 2 hours. If there is a new satellite added, super admin users will see this straight away, without delay. However, a manual process will be required for operators to see this:

1. New satellite in MMS database from Space-Track
2. Super users see all CDMs for any satellite linked to UKSPoC’s Space-Track account
3. Use CAA’s spreadsheet to:
  1. Confirm this is a satellite that the UKSA monitors
  2. Associate the new satellite to the correct organisation
4. Once satellite record exists in MmS database, retrieve size and mass data from ESA DISCOS API & store this object data indefinitely
5. POST MVP enable operator admin or OA to edit/update data fields

Note, to keep our MmS database up-to-date, we are updating our satellite database every two hours. If we need to further check for updates we can query SATCAT for changes to their records.

1. Request class: satcat_change
  1. This enables you to retrieve ~60 days of history showing changes for objects with changes in one of these values: INTLDES, NORAD_CAT_ID, SATNAME, COUNTRY, LAUNCH, or DECAY
  2. We will likely need to do this everyday to ensure that we do not have inaccurate NORAD IDs etc.

<i>Note: NORAD ID only changes for 'unidentified' objects (e.g. debris) which are initially given an 80,000 number ID but when identified will be given an official normal ID. NORAD ID would never change for a satellite, for example.</i>

To confirm and validate which satellites are connected to our Space-Track account we can use the CAR API. This will inform us for which satellites, we are getting CDMs. Current list of UK satellites in use is [CAA’s spreadsheet from Dec 2021] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1INpkHA8cWPJukoAhq6lKhf5V-Qt9E8h3/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109540726810959790990&rtpof=true&sd=true).

##Sourcing data for object information:
|Ingest satellite data into MmS database|                        |
| ------------------------ |------------------------------------ |
| Common Name              | SATCAT: SATNAME                     |
| NORAD ID (primary key)   | SATCAT: NORAD_CAT_ID                |
| International Designator | SATCAT: INTLDES (N/A for debris)    |
| Object Type              | SATCAT: OBJECT_TYPE                 |
| Country                  | SATCAT: COUNTRY                     |
| Launching State          | SATCAT: SITE                        |
| Launching Year           | SATCAT: LAUNCH                      |
| Active/inactive          |                                     |
| Manoeuvrability status   | SATCAT: MANEUVERABLE                |
| Manoeuvrability source   | “Space-Track” at MVP                |
| Mass (kg)                | ESA DISCOS: MASS                    |
| Size                     | ESA DISCOS: LENGTH x HEIGHT x DEPTH |
| Operator                 | ESA DISCOS                          |
| Inclination              | SATCAT: INCLINATION                 |
| Apogee                   | SATCAT: APOGEE                      |
| Perigee                  | SATCAT: PERIGEE                     |
| Period                   | SATCAT: PERIOD                      |
| Comment field            | [OA free text]                      |

The MMS database will contain input from Space-Track and ESA DISCOS. OAs will also be able to update/overwrite object data further down the line. We should display the source of the data when multiple data sources are integrated. In fact, terms and conditions of use of ESA DISCOS data means that the data source must be displayed. Information on where object and event data is sourced should be contained in the standard text pages at the bottom of the event information page too.
###Launching site

See data catalogue. Convert abbreviation from SATCAT to full name and country.

####Post-MVP developments
* At MVP -
  * all fields of data will be sourced from SATCAT
* At post-MVP -
  * ESA DISCOS used for object size, mass and operator?
  * OAs can write in a comment field
* At post-post-MVP -
  * Operators can overwrite fields on their own object
  * Allow OAs to overwrite certain data fields (inc. mass, size, activeness, manoeuvrability)
  * Include a link to source of information
  * Create OA pdf file
* Note - monitoring required for all edits

At post-MVP, OAs and operator admins will be able to overwrite this field and the source field would then state "UKSA OAs". Post-post MVP we could provide a link to the source and give a date that manoeuvrability was last observed.

###Data sources
There will be three sources of object data required:Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) spreadsheet, ESA-DISCOS, and SpaceTrack.

1. <b> Space-Track </b> - API
2. <b>  CAA Excel file </b> - manual handling
3. <b> ESA DISCOS </b> - Object size (l*W*H), mass and operator; API integration
4. <b> Orbital Analyst comment </b> - Adam White has advised that certain data fields in CDMs are incredibly useful when accurate, but are often out of date. We will ensure that active/inactive data and manoeuvrability data is displayed next to their source, and when orbital analysts conduct their own analysis they will be able to overwrite Space Track data in these fields. This information will be uploaded to MmS via manual uploads (JSON files) by OAs.OA will be able to add comments in the JSON files - this is free text but may include size/mass data if they have used different values.

###What the Satellite Information table will look like to the user:

## Alternatives considered
### Alternative sources of data

The Orbital Analyst workbench was considered as an alternative source of data. However, AW informed us that most workbench data is taken from Space-Track and SatCat anyway, so MmS should just take data straight from the source, and to try and pull from a single source as much as possible.

###Alternative data fields

We also considered providing the following information, but discussions with Adam showed that these data fields were often inaccurate or not useful:

* Power is rarely used in analysis and changes throughout a mission's life cycle
* The expected lifetime of a satellite varies and operators can infer this from object altitude. It is also not very relevant for conjunctions. Decay date will be used instead.
* Contractor details are very useful but details are incorrect frequently as email addresses change, people leave, satellites change hands.
* Fleet numbers will not impact decision-making and are often difficult to find.

### Alternative methods of ingesting data

### Asking operators for HBR data when they register for the service
<i>Questions</i>

1. Will the terms and conditions / data privacy agreements need to be updated?
2. How do we validate / confirm operator’s data?
  1. Who has the permission to submit this data?
3. Organisation admins
  1.  How do they submit this data?
4. Easiest for them is likely a csv file, easiest for us would be an online form
5. What is the MVP of this feature?
  Upload a CSV that the OAs can use manually?

Stages
1. Data privacy considerations

## Cross-cutting concerns
*  What are the liability concerns regarding sharing activeness and manoeuvrability data?

##Limits
