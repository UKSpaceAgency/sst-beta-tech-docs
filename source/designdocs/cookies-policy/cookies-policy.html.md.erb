# 017 - Cookies policy

## Purpose
* Cookies are small data files that a website sends to a user’s computer. They’re used to store information about how users browse a website. The service manual tells us to keep use of cookies to a minimum, and be transparent about the ones you do use.
  * Cookies must only apply to your originating domain name. For example, www.servicename.service.gov.uk not .gov.uk.
  * Do not use cookies on domains that host only static assets like images or JavaScript - they slow response times for users without providing any benefit.
  * You should only send cookies with the Secure attribute and, when appropriate, the HttpOnly attribute. These flags provide additional assurances about how browsers should handle cookies.

## Goals
* Decide which cookies to use and how to use them - essential and non-essential
* Define our cookie policy

## Essential cookies
