# 009. Key performance indicators

## Purpose
In order to assess the performance of the service and user satisfaction, we must measure and assess a range of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

## Context and scope
This aligns with the requirements of GDS Service standard 10:"Work out what success looks like for your service and identify metrics which will tell you whatâ€™s working and what can be improved, combined with user research."

### Goals of this design documentation include:
* To briefly outline what success looks like for Monitor my Satellites
* To document the KPIs that MmS has chosen to focus on and how these will be measured
* To assess the benefits of the service to users, linking back to user needs
* To consider the addition of new KPIs as the service develops (post-MVP KPIs)

## What does success look like for Monitor my Satellites?

Through the creation of Monitor my Satellites, the UKSA hopes to develop a central UK system that will notify users about upcoming high probability collision events, collating information into one place and sharing additional analysis conducted by UK orbital analysts. The UKSA aims to create an easy-to-understand but high quality service.

We have identified a number of metrics that will help us determine the performance of the service and what can be improved, that will be outlined below.

## Mandatory KPIs

According to the GDS, it is mandatory to publish data on 4 main key performance indicators; cost per transaction, completion rate, user satisfaction and digital take up.

As MmS is not a transactional service, we will not report on [Cost per transaction](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measuring-success/measuring-cost-per-transaction) and [Completion rate](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measuring-success/measuring-completion-rate).

#### [User satisfaction](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measuring-success/measuring-user-satisfaction):
  * Whilst being an essential performance metric to all services, user satisfaction is a more challenging metric to quantify and largely relies on interacting with our users (through the feedback banner on site, users being invited to stand-ups after releases or incidents, and surveys throughout private beta) and asking them to explain:
    * Satisfaction levels with the service
    * How MmS changed user behaviour/ informed decision making
    * Whether the information was easy to understand and use
    * How long it took to study and understand the information provided by the service

Here is a prototype of the current feedback form for all users, based on GDS examples. The feedback form is accessible by users from the beta banner that displays at the top of all pages:

![Prototype of feedback form](designdocs/key-performance-indicators/feedback-form-prototype.png "Prototype of feedback form")

#### [Digital take-up](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measuring-success/measuring-digital-take-up)
* As Monitor my satellites is not replacing an existing service/non-digital channel and we have selected a user base at private beta, digital take up will be monitored by measuring:
  * The ratio of number of notifications sent to the number of log-ins and event information views per user (will be monitored through Notify and piwik pro). The correlation between these variables can also be monitored graphically over the course of private beta.
  * This metric will enable us to understand how often the operators use the service when there is an event that meets their thresholds and hence they are interested in.

## Additional KPIs specific to monitoring the success of MmS

During the private beta, key outputs to be assessed have been split into 3 categories; user satisfaction (already discussed above), service performance and user activity.

#### Service performance will be monitored by looking at:
* Mean time to repair, mean time between failures, mean time to acknowledge, mean time to fix
* Service availability (hours/day)
* Time for each page to load
* Time from API request to response
* Service downtime

#### User activity:
* Number of sign ins per user (Auth0)
* Number of notifications sent and delivered (monitored via Notify)
* Number of visits to different pages on the site and time spent there (piwik pro)
* Ephemeris uploads using the confirmation of successful ephemeris data as a proxy for this (piwik pro)
* Event Analysis uplaods using the confirmation of successful analysis data as a proxy for this (piwik pro)
* Where users come from (are they prompted by email notifications or sporadically visit the site to check in - referrels on piwik pro)

## Assessing the benefits of the service

Below are some of the key user needs with the most evidence & how we will measure the benefit of each:

## The future of capturing and publishing KPIs for MmS
As mentioned previously, we will need to monitor and track a range of KPIs during the private beta. However, we also should prepare for what metrics we should track in later stages of the project.

#### Post-MVP KPIs will include:
* Number of times event history accordion opened - if more than (x%) of time, should it be an accordion?
* Time between ephemeris upload and analysis being generated and uploaded
* Time between analysis being completed and the Time of Closest Approach (TCA)
* The number of API requests
* User journeys (heat maps)
