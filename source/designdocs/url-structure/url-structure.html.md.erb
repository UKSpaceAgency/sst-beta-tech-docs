# 012 - URL structure

## Purpose
This design document proposed a design for URLs for Monitor Space Hazards. The actual design is mostly similar, but not all levels were used.

##Context and scope
URLs will be visible to the users in their address bar and in the notifications they are sent out.

We can expect most users to come in at their homepage in most instances. All notifications will point people to the homepage.

The top level domain is out of scope for this document but is assumed to be GDS-compliant and along the lines of

`https://monitor-space-hazards.service.gov.uk/`

##Goals and non-goals

###Goals
1. A good URL is one which is unique, permanent, and hackable.
2. It should be compliant with the [GOV.UK URL standards] (https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/url-standards-for-gov-uk).

Monitor Space Hazards has a very limited number of URLs which can be structured simply to easily comply with the above principles.

###Non-Goals
* Avoiding inconsistencies

##The actual design

### Event URLs
The generic event structure should be in the format:

```/[event type]/[event ID]/[view]?[modifier]```

Event URLs will be in the format

* `/[event type]/[event ID]` - event homepage

Alert URLs will be in the format

* `/[event type]/[event ID]/[alert]` - alert homepage

#### Example conjunction event URLs

| Page                                                 | URL stage 1         | URL stage 2                   | URL stage 3                                |  
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Service homepage                                     | `/ `                 |                               |                                            |
| Conjunction homepage                                 | `/conjunctions`      |                               |                                            |
| Conjunction event                                    | `/conjunctions`      | `/xxxx-yyyyy-zzzz`            |                                            |
| Conjunction alert                                    | `/conjunctions`      | `/xxxx-yyyyy-zzzz`            | `/alert`                                   |

#### Example re-entry event URLs

| Page                                                 | URL stage 1         | URL stage 2                   | URL stage 3                                |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Service homepage                                     | `/ `                 |                               |                                            |
| Re-entries homepage                                  | `/re-entries`        |                               |                                            |
| Re-entry event                                       | `/re-entries`        | `/re-11111111-1111`           |                                            |
| Re-entry alert                                       | `/conjunctions`      | `/re-11111111-1111`           | `/alert`                                   |


###Satellite URLs

The generic satellite structure should be in the format:

`/satellites/[satellite ID].[file extension]`


Satellite URLs will therefore be in the format

* `/satellites` - all satellites visible to the user
* `/satellites/[satellite ID]` - satellite homepage
* `/satellites/[satellite ID].ext` - downloadable satellite information

###Example satellite URLs

| Page                         | URL stage 1   | URL stage 2   | URL stage 3        |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| Organisation satellites page | `/satellites` |               |                    |
| Satellite page|`/satellites` | `/1234567890` |               |                    |
| Satellite page               | `/satellites` | `/1234567890` | `/ephemeris-upload`|
| Download data as a csv       | `/satellites` | `/1234567890` | `.csv`             |

###Account URLs

The generic account structure should be in the format:

`/[task]-item`

Admin URLs will therefore be in the format
* `/view-notifications` - view notifications for all satellites
* `/edit-notifications` - set notifications for all satellites (with the option to clock through to in

####Example admin URLs

| Page                                  | URL stage 1    | URL stage 2                               | URL stage 3 |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Terms and conditions                  | `/account`     | `/terms-and-conditions`                   |             |
| View contact details                  | `/account`     | `/contact-and-organisation-information`   |             |
| View and edit notification settings   | `/account`     | `/notification-settings`                  |             |
| View and edit notification thresholds | `/account`     | `/event-notification-thresholds-settings` |             |
| Organisation information              | `/account`     | `/organisation`                           |             |
| Add new user                          | `/account`     | `/add-new-user`                           |             |

##Sign in URLs

The generic <b>sign in</b> structure should be in the format:

`/sign-in`

###Example log in URLs

| Page                                                  | URL stage 1   | URL stage 2      | URL stage 3 |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| Email sign in page                                    | `/sign-in`    |                  |             |
| Magic link takes you to “Proceed to my homepage” page | `/sign-in`    | `?token={token}` |             |

##Alternatives considered

* <b>Events:</b> Contact and upload pages being top level pages eg `/contact/[event ID]` rather than vice versa.
  * Rejected to ensure that the URL remained hackable and that contacts to orbital analysts were always related to a specific event.
* <b>Satellites:</b> Satellite IDs not being in their own directory, ie a Satellite URL would be just `[satellite ID]`
  * Rejected to ensure that the URL remained hackable and that all satellites connected to an organisation could be collected at `/satellites`
* Many different UUIDs for events were considered as part of the UID design paper.

##Cross-cutting concerns
URLs are themselves dependent on the UUID structure for an event. The unity between UUID and URLs allows for strong human-readable debugging and analysis.
