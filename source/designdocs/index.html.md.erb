# Design Docs

The Monitor my Satellite Service Team is experimenting with the
use of [Design Docs] to articulate substantial design work that needs
a broad consensus. This is partly due to working remotely in multiple
languages, but also to coalesce design concerns in one place.

Although conceptually very similar to [Architecture Decision Records]
they are broader in scope and/or involve the wider stakeholder community
beyond the technical team (hence the use of Google Docs).
