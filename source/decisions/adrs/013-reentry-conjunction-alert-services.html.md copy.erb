# 013. Developing re-entry and conjunction alert services

Date: 2024-01-22

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Currently, UKSA provides re-entry and conjunction alerts to the UK government. These alerts are manually produced and subsequently distributed to UK government users, but these manual reports are time-consuming for operators to produce, and result in unnecessary delays to cross-government communication. 

## Decision

A Discovery phase and Alpha phase determined digital and automatically distributed re-entry and conjunction alerts for government users would be beneficial both to the users of reports and their producers. 

UKSA and The PSC are therefore in the process of a private beta for developing re-entry and conjunction alert capabilities within the current digital service, with the intention to roll out a full live service in 2024. 

## Consequences

The development of such a service will provide government users and operators seamless access to re-entry and conjunction alerts as part of their existing account.
