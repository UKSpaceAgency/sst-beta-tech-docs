# 018. Use Mapbox to create interactive maps

Date: 2025-09-03

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Users of the Track Re-entry Events service require interactive and filterable map views of re-entry paths to understand the spatial awareness of objects. 

The solution must be able to:

* Integrate with existing backend services to display re-entry data.
* Adopt custom styles to align with UKSA and NSpOC branding and accessibility requirements.
* Display multiple flight paths, overlays and event annotations.
* Be interactive and filterable.

## Decision

We agreed to adopt Mapbox as the mapping framework for visualisations of re-entry events.

Mapbox was chosen over alternatives (e.g., Google Maps) based on considerations of licensing costs and the ability to customise the map.

## Consequences

Users will be able to explore re-entry data in the form of interactive map visualisations, improving spatial awareness and decision-making. Development work is expected to manage Mapbox licensing and integration with backend data.
