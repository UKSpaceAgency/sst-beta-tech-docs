# 003. Use Piwik Pro for Web Analytics on Monitor your satellites

Date: 2021-07-04

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Web analytics are required on the Monitor your satellites application to measure and report on usage and detect usability improvements. 

## Decision

In line with the Government Service Standard recommendations around Open Source and focus on privacy and data security we have decided to use [Piwik Pro (core)](https://piwik.pro/core-plan/). 
This allows us to use all three of its components including analytics, tag manager and the concent manager that allows us to register user consent.

## Consequences

Quantitative understanding of usage of the website. Able to report on basic user statistics and track event downloads.
