# 006. Use of GOV.UK PaaS

Date: 2022-07-18

## Status

Accepted

## Context

GOV.UK Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud-hosting platform built by the Government Digital Services (GDS). GOV.UK
PaaS manages the deployment of Monitor Space Hazards, the backing services it relies on (such as the filesystem and database) and
background tasks, such that people with specialised cloud skills aren't needed.

GOV.UK PaaS uses the open source [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) project, and runs on [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/).

## Decision

The decision to use GOV.UK PaaS was taken in the alpha phase of the service lifecycle. It was only used in earnest during
private beta, and along with the decision to use Terraform for IaC, has provided good utility. However as time has
progressed and service needs have matured, then breaking out and consuming AWS native services has become more of a concern.


## Consequences

On the [12th July 2022](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2022/07/12/why-weve-decided-to-decommission-gov-uk-paas-platform-as-a-service/)
decommissioning of Gov.UK PaaS was announced, so the Service Team will start to investigate a new hosting platform now.
