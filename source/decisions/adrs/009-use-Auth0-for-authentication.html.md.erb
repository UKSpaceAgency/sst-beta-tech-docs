# 009. Use Auth0 as a secure authentication solution on Monitor your satellites

Date: 2022-07-19

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Following the use of Magic Links to log into the service and subsequent PenTest, it was identified as a medium risk and recommended a more traditional authentication standard was used. 

## Decision

We decided to integrate with Auth0. Auth0 is a flexible, drop-in SaaS solution to add authentication and authorisation services to applications. It will save on cost, time, and risk that comes with building our own solution to authenticate and authorise users.

From the web: Auth0 is an identity and access management platform that provides authentication and authorization solutions for web, mobile, and legacy applications. It offers features such as single sign-on, social login, multi-factor authentication, and user management.

## Consequences

We use a familiar OAuth standard for authorisation of users that is secure and scalable.
