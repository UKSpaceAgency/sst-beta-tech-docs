# 003. Use CosmicJs as headless CMS

Date: 2022-07-05

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need the ability to create new static webpages without touching the codebase of application.

## Decision

We will use the headless CMS [Cosmicjs](https://www.cosmicjs.com/), which allows us to create new static pages and edit existing pages such as Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy without interfering with codebase. The free version enables us to have one seat - we will review whether this is adequate in the future. 

## Consequences

Easy way to create and edit static pages on site that don't require dynamic updates.
