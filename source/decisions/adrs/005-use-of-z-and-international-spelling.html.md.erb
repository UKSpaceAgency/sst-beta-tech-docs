# 005. Use of 'z' and international spelling

Date: 2022-07-14

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Unify the naming convention for words with British & International spelling within the codebase and API (i.e. the backend) e.g. `organization` vs `organisation`. 

## Decision

Use international version of spelling the word (e.g. `organization`) in all backend instances and code base. Localised versions on front end web pages.

## Consequences

Codebase that is consistent with universal standards.
