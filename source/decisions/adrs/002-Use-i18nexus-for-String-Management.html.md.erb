# 001. Use i18Nexus for string editing and international translation versioning

Date: 2022-07-05

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Solution to avoid hardcoded strings in application that will vary dependent on language.

## Decision

Internationalisation framework [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) gives us control over strings across the whole application.
We can easily edit strings, translate them (in future - e.g. Welsh) and add new text. Strings are organised by page.

## Consequences

Full control over application text without touching code.
