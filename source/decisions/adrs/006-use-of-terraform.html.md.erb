# 006. Use of Terraform

Date: 2022-07-18

## Status

Accepted

## Context

[HashiCorp Terraform](https://content.hashicorp.com/api/assets?product=terraform&version=v1.2.5&asset=website%2Fintro%2Findex.html)
is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that defines infrastructure resources in human-readable configuration files
that are open for version control, re-use and sharing. It allows a consistent workflow for safely and efficiently provisioning
and managing infrastructure throughout the entire lifecycle.

## Decision

Not many alternatives were considered, since Terraform is dominant for IaC in the UK Public Sector, so there is a healthy
marketplace of people with these skills. The Infrastructure for MyS has been defined [here](https://github.com/UKSpaceAgency/sst-beta-infra)
in Terraform.

## Consequences

One useful consequence is that with the decommissioning of Gov.UK PaaS announcement, dated [12th July 2022](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2022/07/12/why-weve-decided-to-decommission-gov-uk-paas-platform-as-a-service/)
then the new hosting environment will be defined in Terraform also, allowing seamless migration and continuity of skills.
