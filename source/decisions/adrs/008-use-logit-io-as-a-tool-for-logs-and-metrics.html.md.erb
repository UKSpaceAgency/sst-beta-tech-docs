# 008. Use Logit.io as a tool for logs and metrics on Monitor your satellites

Date: 2022-07-19

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Tools for gathering and analysing logs are crucial for the Monitor your satellites application and needed for debugging issues and monitoring the application itself.

## Decision

An ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) is considered to be one of the best ways of handling logs ingestion and monitoring. To lift the burden of hosting and managing the stack ourselves, we decided to use the SaaS solution [Logit.io](https://www.logit.io). Logit.io is also documented in the GOV.UK PaaS documentation as a tried and tested solution for use with Cloud Foundry.


## Consequences

We have the ability to quickly search and analyse logs across all environments and all applications.
