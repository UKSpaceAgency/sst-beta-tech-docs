# 011. Migrate the service from GOV.UK PaaS to AWS

Date: 2023-04-01

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Agency is required to obtain a new cloud hosting service after being notified that their current hosting provider, GOV.UK PaaS, is being decommissioned at the end of December 2023



## Decision

The Agency is seeking a cloud-hosting platform to migrate the current technical architecture of Monitor space hazards (based on Cloud Foundry on top of AWS) with minimal changes required to the code base and architecture.

Within this there are several sub-objectives:

1. Provide cost-effective hosting of current MSH technical architecture – the new cloud hosting service must be able to host the current configuration (including PostgreSQL, S3 buckets and Docker containers) with minimal reconfiguration

2. Meet future service needs of MSH – the new cloud hosting service must be scalable in a cost-effective manner with global availability and should provide a large selection of cloud components to allow for upgrades and transformation of the current service (e.g. cron-lik events, logging/alerting services, serverless components)

3. Allow for seamless migration of data from GOV.UK PaaS – the new hosting service must provide tools and components that allow for migration of data from the current production database in GOV.UK PaaS with no/minimal downtime

4. Meet technical and data security requirements for OFFICIAL data – the new hosting service should be accredited to Cyber Essentials Plus, ISO27001 and permit penetration testing to CHECK standards by an external supplier

The target architecture and phasing will look to achieve the following set up.
