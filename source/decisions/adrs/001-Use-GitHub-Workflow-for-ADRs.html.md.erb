# 001. Use GitHub Workflow for ADRs

Date: 2021-10-01

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Architectural Decisions are not made in isolation and need to be discussed and agreed amongst the Service Team.

## Decision

Utilise [GitHub Workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) to manage the acceptance, or not, of ADRs by
the Service Team. The Pull Request review process, prior to merging into `main`, provides suitable mechanisms for
tracking comments, amendments, approvals and so on.

## Consequences

Basic understanding of GitHub Workflow for all participants in the ADR authoring and approval process.
