# 01. Understand users and their needs

Develop a deep understanding of users and the problem youâ€™re trying to solve for them.

### Doing user research to [understand what users need](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/start-by-learning-user-needs) and, where relevant, secondary research and analysis

* We have done significant quantities of user research throughout Discovery, Alpha, and Private Beta
  * Discovery: user group research, including semi-structured interviews and understanding current process flows with approximately 60% of UK-licensed satellite operators, orbital analysts, critical national infrastructure groups, space weather forecasters, and diplomats.
  * Alpha: we spoke with 75% of UK-licensed operators to understand their user needs for our service. We tested a prototype of the service to assess usability and functionality. Most operators were interviewed twice to ensure that iterations of the user interface were appropriate and suitable. All user needs were recorded in the user needs database and interview notes saved to SharePoint for future reference. We continued to work with orbital analysts and expanded our research to academics at Cranfield University.
  * Private beta: we have continued to do extensive research. Before the service was released to private beta in January, we tested with Cranfield University students to avoid testing fatigue from our users. In private beta we have onboarded 3 UK licensed operators, and have followed up with 1 on 1 sessions, drop in sessions, and data analysis.
* The Monitor my satellites beta site has a beta feedback banner and a form to collect feedback.

### Building quick, throwaway [prototypes](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/making-prototypes) to test their hypotheses

* We have used the GDS prototype kit throughout including to test new functionality within private beta before building.
* We have also used lower fidelity artefacts where appropriate: for instance we mocked up tables in a google doc in order to experiment with different ways of displaying data.
* Prototypes have been used throughout the project to test UI design ideas quickly

### Using [web analytics](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2014/08/12/helping-government-find-user-needs-with-analytics/) and other data that's available (for example from government call centres or [third party services](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2018/01/10/working-with-citizens-advice-and-its-amazing-data/)) to enhance their understanding of the problem

* Web analytics are used to better understand how users interact with the service at private beta
* Piwik Pro is used to track front-end analytics. It tracks and reports website traffic and user activity. Piwik Pro is a free web analytics programme similar to Google Analytics but without sharing users data wider than Monitor My Satellites. Features include:
  * Tracking page views, bounce rates and average time per page
  * Tracking mouse-clicking, scrolling and hovering behaviours
  * Heatmaps that show you visually where your visitors try to click, move the mouse and how far down they scroll on each page.
  * Session recordings to see firsthand the user-experience of visitors on your website
* Users in the private beta will be able to provide feedback on the service via an online form (linked in the beta header) or through attending our drop-in sessions/interviews.
