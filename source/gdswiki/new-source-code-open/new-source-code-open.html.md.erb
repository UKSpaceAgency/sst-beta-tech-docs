# 12. Make new source code open

Make all new source code open and reusable, and publish it under appropriate licences. Or if this isn’t possible, provide a convincing explanation of why this can’t be done for specific subsets of the source code.

### Write code in the open from the start, and publish it in an open repository - minus any sensitive information, like secret keys and credentials

* All code is stored and published on the USKA GitHub
* We have 3 repositories, 1 public and 2 currently private.
* We are aiming to make the other 2 public in the next 2 sprints
* GDS patterns and components have been used throughout
* All design decisions have been documented and shared on the public tech docs site for all stakeholders to view

### Keep ownership of the intellectual property of new source code that’s created as part of the service, and make it available for reuse under an open licence

* Intellectual property of MmS belongs to UKSA

### There are a few cases[ when you should not publish code in the open](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-source-guidance/when-code-should-be-open-or-closed). For example, code that relates to a sensitive government policy that hasn't been announced yet.

* At the moment UKSA has not yet decided whether it wants to use MmS as a soft power tool to work with other national space agencies. If it did, it may want to keep some source code private
* We also need to understand limits to our agreements with Space-Track and ESA DISCOS which might reduce our freedom here
* However, we are hopeful that we will be able to do so.
