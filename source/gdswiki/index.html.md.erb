# GDS Wiki

The Monitor space hazards Service Team is recording the ways in which the project meets the Government Digital Service Standards. This is being done via a series of documents that make up a GDS Wiki.

This has been updated as the project has developed, to ensure that all decisions are taken with the Service Standards in mind.
The GDS was initially created using Google Docs to record decisions and features to allow for collaborative and transparent working, with documents then being brought to the tech doc site in the spirit of transparency and openess.
