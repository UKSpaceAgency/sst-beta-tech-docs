# 07. Use agile ways of working

Create the service using agile, iterative user-centred methods.

### Use [agile ways of working](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery) - inspecting, learning and adapting as they go

* Throughout the project we ran regular agile ceremonies, including:
  * Daily stand-ups (15 mins every morning)
  * Weekly sprint review & planning sessions
  * Show & tells with internal stakeholders
* These ceremonies allowed us to plan effectively, communicate with members of the team and collaborate as much as possible.
* Workload and tasks were tracked on Jira and updated regularly. Members of the project were allocated tasks via tickets on Jira, and all team members had full access to the board, should they have wanted to keep track of progress or view a particular task. Jira tickets and progress on them were discussed at daily stand ups.
* Design documents were created using Google docs to articulate substantial design work that needs a broad consensus. This is partly due to working remotely in multiple languages, but also to coalesce design concerns in one place. These documents were shared with all team members, as well as internal stakeholders beyond just the technical team via a tech docs site.

### Have governance arrangements that are consistent with the [agile governance principles](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/governance-principles-for-agile-service-delivery) and make sure that the right people know what’s happening with the service, at the right level of detail (including, for example, the minister or chief executive)

* Everyone in the delivery team is responsible and involved in the governance. We have a different list of attendees per agile ceremony, to ensure that people only attend the relevant level of governance where they are required.
* We have daily stand-ups which are less than 15 minutes where everyone takes it in turn to discuss what they achieved yesterday; their plan for today; and any interdependencies/meetings they need to set-up.

### Where appropriate and proportionate, test the service with the minister or relevant senior stakeholder

* The product was tested with a range of government stakeholders at disco and alpha.
* Senior stakeholders including UKSA’s CDO also attend regular show and tells for updates on progress and in fact he has several ideas to use the aggregated data being produced
* The link to access the prototype remains consistent throughout the project, and users who have been engaged are invited to return to the prototype to review how their input has been integrated.
