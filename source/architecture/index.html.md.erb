# Architecture

The Service Team decided to use the [C4 Model] to visual the Software Architecture for the Service.

The essence, and hence the name, are the four Cs:

* Context
* Containers
* Components
* Code

All diagrams have been automatically generated in [Structurizr].

See [detailed technical architecture diagram] (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1E13oV-xd8BaQZcFAPIjpWLYyR8Qxhxv6MlpCjNg5tk8/edit?usp=sharing) for more information.
