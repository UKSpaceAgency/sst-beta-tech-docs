# Architecture

The Service Team decided to use the [C4 Model] to visual the Software Architecture for the Service.

The essence, and hence the name, are the four Cs:

* [Context](./context/)
* [Containers](./containers/)
* [Components](./components/)
* [Code](./code/)

All diagrams have been automatically generated in [Structurizr].
