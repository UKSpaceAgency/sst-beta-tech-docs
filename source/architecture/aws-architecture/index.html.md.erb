# AWS Architecture

This diagram provides a comprehensive overview of the AWS infrastructure for the Monitor Space Hazards system, highlighting key services, deployment environments, and data flows.

![Components](images/awsArchitecture.png)

- **Users** access the system via the internet, routed through **AWS WAF** and **Amazon CloudFront** for security, caching, and distribution.
- **Application Load Balancer** distributes traffic to the **Web Application Service** and **API Service** running in **ECS Fargate** across dev, demo, and prod environments.
- **Web Application Service** provides the frontend interface, consuming data from the **API Service**, while users can also interact directly with the API if preferred.
- **Data Cache Solution**: comprises a **Producer Service** (prod only, connects to **SpaceTrack** to avoid throttling) and **Consumer Service** (dev, demo, prod), orchestrating ingestion and processing of external data.
- **Amazon Aurora** hosts the primary relational database across dev, demo, and prod, with all write operations coming from the API and data cache consumer.
- **Amazon S3** stores raw and processed data; **SNS** and **SQS** manage asynchronous notifications and queueing for event-driven workflows.
- **AWS Secrets Manager** securely stores application secrets and credentials, accessible by services running in Fargate.
- **Amazon EventBridge** orchestrates event-driven triggers across the system.
- **Amazon ECR** stores container images for Fargate deployments.
- **Amazon CloudWatch** monitors application and infrastructure metrics, logs, and alerts.
- **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)** and **Route 53** manage TLS certificates and DNS routing.
- **Auth0** handles user authentication and identity management.
