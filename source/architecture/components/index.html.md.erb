# Components

In this view the components for the API Application are in focus. This is due to it being the core container for the
logic in the service, other containers such as the Web Application mirror its components, or in the case of the
SpaceTrack Application are a subset.

[OpenApi](https://swagger.io/specification/) documentation is available directly on the [API server](https://api.monitor-my-satellites.space/docs#/).

The components for Monitor Your Satellites are:

* **Satellite** - this component allows the retrieval of Satellites information from MyS. It can also trigger data
import from SpaceTrack and ESA Discos.
* **Satellite Conjunction Event** - this component allows the retrieval of conjunctions events raised by MyS for Satellites
that it is monitoring. Additional details of data sources for the event and the associated SpaceTrack CDM ID are also
available.
* **CDMS** - this component manages the SpaceTrack integration. It can trigger a new synchronisation and return the latest
CDM ID imported.
* **Analyses** - this component can retrieve analyses from Orbital Analysis, and allows them to be uploaded (if the user has
appropriate permissions).
* **Users** - this component manages the users of the service. It allows for their creation, updates and deletion.
* **Ephemeris** - this component allows the upload and download of ephemeris data by Orbital Analysts and Satellite Operators.
* **Health-Check** - this component provides a health-check function for the application.
* **Statistics** - this component returns key statistical information on data within MyS.
* **External Data Performance** - this component returns performance data for external datasources.
