# Context

This context diagram is a good starting point for visualising the context that the service operates in.

This is technically a Landscape diagram, since it shows the CAA's regulatory role, but that is the only difference from
the Context diagram, so that term has been used for simplicity.

It is noteworthy that the Monitor Space Hazards software system consumes third-party SaaS services for commodity / utility features such as,
web analytics ([Piwik Pro](https://piwik.pro/)), logging ([Logit.io](https://logit.io/)), security alerting
([Sentry](https://sentry.io/)), authentication ([Auth0](https://auth0.com/)), source code versioning
and CI/CD pipelines ([GitHub](https://github.com/)).
