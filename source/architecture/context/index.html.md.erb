# Context

This context diagram is a good starting point for visualising the context that the service operates in.

This is technically a System Landscape diagram, as it highlights the CAA's regulatory role. However, for simplicity, it has been referred to as a Context diagram.

The Monitor Space Hazards (MSH) software system integrates with several third-party SaaS services to provide utility and supporting functionality, including:

* **Web analytics** – Google Analytics
* **Content management** – Cosmic CMS
* **Logging and monitoring** – AWS CloudWatch
* **Security alerting** – Sentry
* **Authentication** – Auth0
* **Source code versioning and CI/CD pipelines** – GitHub

These integrations enable MSH to focus on its core functionality while leveraging established platforms for standard services.
