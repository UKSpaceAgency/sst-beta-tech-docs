# Containers

Once the fit of the system in the overall landscape is understood it useful to zoom in to the system boundary.

Although this diagram isn't particularly interesting in it's own right, it does highlight a separation of concerns.

Some things to note are:

* The API and SpaceTrack Applications are the only ones that write to the persistence tier (database and filesystem).
* The Web Application is an API client written for MYS users to browse, but they can directly integrate with the API with
their own client if preferred.
* The SpaceTrack Application has one concern, to synchronize data in MYS with SpaceTrack.
* Only the Web and API applications are routed and available over the Internet.
