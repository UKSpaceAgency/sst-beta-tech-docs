As an approver, you are able to make edits to both re-entry and conjunction reports, adding additional information where appropriate to the auto-generated reports. This document gives detail on where edits can be made, on how to make edits, and how edits are shown to users. 

### 1. Re-entry alert sections that can be edited:

Approver users can make edits using free text additions to some of the automatically populated generic passages in a re-entry report. Edits should be used to add event-specific information that is important but not automatically captured.

The sections that can be edited are the following for re-entries. 

1. Executive summary
2. Immediate response
3. Recovery and clean up
4. Liability for damages
5. Press attention

Making edits through the editing interface will add text below the generic text for all of these 5 categories. The generic text cannot be edited.

### 2. Conjunction alert sections that can be edited:

Editing conjunction alert reports works the same as re-entries. The editable sections are:

1. Executive summary
2. Manoeuvre expected?
3. Immediate impact
4. Short term impact
5. Long term impact
6. UK response
7. Press attention

### 3. Making edits:

As an approver, all re-entry/conjunction alert pages will display a banner at the top of the page which gives you the option to either edit the report or send it to additional recipients. 

If you choose to edit a report you will be taken to a page displaying each of the editable sections. Each section will display the current generic content, and a free text box where text additions can be made. Once you have added your free text additions to your desired sections, you can proceed to review edits at the bottom of the page.

### 4. Making edits:

**Review edits:** Proceeding to the review edits page allows you to see a table containing your free text edits by section. If you wish to make further edits, you can return to the previous page and do so. Once happy with your edits, you can proceed to a final report preview.

**Final preview and publishing:** Proceeding to the final preview page allows you to see your text edits in the report itself, below the generic auto-populated text. Once happy with your edits as shown on the report page, you can publish them using the ‘publish edits’ button. 

Once published, you can make further edits, either in addition or instead of your existing edits, by repeating the process above.

### 5. How edits are shown to users:

Once edits are published all users will be able to see the edits on the live report page.
