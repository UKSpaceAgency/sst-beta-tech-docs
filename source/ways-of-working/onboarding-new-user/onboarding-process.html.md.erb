### Invitation to webinar

<b>Attachment</b>: Monitor Space Hazards flyer

<b>Subject</b>: New UK collision assessment service ‘Monitor Space Hazards’

Hi there,

[Introduction depending on operator and how we got in contact with them]

We are reaching out to all UK-licensed satellite operators to invite you to join Monitor Space Hazards. Monitor Space Hazards is a collision assessment service that provides clear, actionable data to help satellite operators make informed decisions regarding potential conjunction events, helping make space usage safe and sustainable for all.


I have attached a flyer providing some more information about the benefits of using the service, but we believe the best way to understand the service is to see it in action. We would like to invite you to a webinar where we will demonstrate the service and answer any questions you may have.


If you are interested, please let us know some dates that would work for you, and I will book some time in.


We look forward to hearing from you!

### Follow up after Webinar

<b>Attachments</b>: Roadmap for public beta, most up to date terms and conditions

<b>Subject</b>: Monitor Space Hazards webinar followup

Hi,

Thank you for the great interest and engagement you showed during the Monitor Space Hazards webinar today. It was great to hear your questions and feedback! To follow up, I have included a few documents in this email.


Firstly, I have attached a roadmap for our public beta but the main features we are working on will be:

[Summary of features currently being developed and plan for future development]

Secondly, you can find out more about the use of API on Monitor Space Hazards via these links:

 * [How to use the API] (https://mys-tech-docs.onrender.com/ways-of-working/use-the-api/use-the-api.html)
 * [API documentation] (https://api.monitor-space-hazards.service.gov.uk/docs)


The next step is to read through the T&Cs that are attached to this email. Just to flag, that there is nothing to sign but your commercial/legal folks would need to be comfortable with them before we can give you access. When you set up your Monitor Space Hazards accounts you will then be asked to agree to the T&Cs before proceeding.


Please let us know if you have any further questions regarding the service or any of the documents attached to this email.


Kind regards,


### Once terms and conditions have been agreed

[Email to be updated once self-serve user creation has been introduced]

<b>Subject:</b> Accessing Monitor Space Hazards

Hi,

Thank you for agreeing to the Terms and Conditions of Monitor Space Hazards, we are very excited to have you on board!

We will now be able to set up your user accounts for you. To do this, we will need some details (that can be filled in the tables below):


* Name, email address and phone number details of the folks you want to give an account to and what level of permissions you'd like them to have (I've added some info below on user types). Phone number is in case people want to receive SMS notifications but if not comfortable you can omit these.
* We'll also need a list of the satellites/assets that you wish to be monitored and connected to your account - we have the SATCAT from Space-Track and ESA of course but it's better to get the Operator to confirm as we've had instances where the catalogue is not up to date. If you can provide any of the NORAD IDs, common names or international designators, that would be great and we can identify them.

In the not-too-distant future, you'll be able to manage users in your organisation yourself but at the minute, we still need to do the set up for you. Once we have created the accounts, you will receive an invitation to set your password and when you finish setting up your accounts you will be asked to click to accept the T&Cs.

Looking forward to getting you onboard!

### Welcome email once accounts have been set up

[Email to be updated once self-serve user creation has been introduced]

<b>Subject:</b> You can now access Monitor Space Hazards

Hi,

Thank you for sending over your user details. We have set up your accounts and you should receive an invitation to set your password for UK Space Agency’s Monitor Space Hazards service from the authentication provider, Auth0. Please follow the instructions in that email. You can go to [https://www.monitor-space-hazards.service.gov.uk](https://www.monitor-space-hazards.service.gov.uk) once you have set your password.

When you first enter the site, you will have to finish setting up your account before you can view any event or satellite information. Account set up will include:

* Confirming that your account details are correct
* Choosing your notification thresholds
* Choosing your notification settings
* Accepting the terms and conditions

Once this is complete, everything should be good to go. You should be able to view your satellites linked to your account, and any upcoming conjunction events involving them.

Here is a link to a brief introduction to using the site: [Demonstration of Monitor Space Hazards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ba0cGB2JVWM).

As this is a pilot service, we would like your feedback to help iterate and improve the service. You can get in touch via email or the feedback banner on each page of the site.

Please contact us if you have any problems signing in or if you have any questions.

Welcome to Monitor Space Hazards!
