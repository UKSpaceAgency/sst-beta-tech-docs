# How to deploy Monitor your satellites

Monitor your satellites (Mys) manages most of its resources through Terraform, this is the repo
[UKSpaceAgency/sst-beta-infra](https://github.com/UKSpaceAgency/sst-beta-infra).

Everything that is automated comes through executing the GitHub Workflow
[Deploy to PaaS](https://github.com/UKSpaceAgency/sst-beta-infra/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy-to-paas.yml).

The sequence for starting the deployment is to:

1. Navigate to the Actions tab
2. Select the Deploy to GOV.UK PaaS workflow
3. Run the workflow

The workflow accepts two inputs:

1. Invoker - enter the command to execute, valid values are:
  * `plan` - executes a `terraform plan`, which creates an execution plan and facilitates previewing of changes.
  * `apply` - executes a `terraform apply`, which generates a new Terraform plan and executes it.
  * In addition to apply there are targeted invokers, namely `front-end` and `back-end`. They execute a Terraform
    `apply` but with the `-target` option set to `module.front-end` or `module.back-end` respectively.
2. Environment - enter the environment to execute against, valid values are:
  * `dev` - Development
  * `demo` - Demonstration / Staging / Test
  * `prod` - Production

**Note:** Don't forget to hit the "Run Workflow" button

This now brings you to the job summary page, where the job's execution and completion status are given. The image
below shows a successfully completed job:

It is possible to click-through to the defined jobs.

1. Objective - this is the first job and provides an output of the inputs for the workflow execution.

2. Deploy - this is the second job and outputs the log from the terraform execution.

If all is successful then the following is seen:

But if the job fails then this is seen:

![Failed execution](deploy-to-paas-7.png)

In this case, logs need to be read and the reason for failure fixed. It's probably time to contact the Service Team.
