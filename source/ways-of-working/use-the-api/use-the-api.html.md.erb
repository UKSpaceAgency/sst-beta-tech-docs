# How to use the API

##Purpose

Monitor your satellites exposes the REST API for gathering all the data available via the application frontend. The same content can be fetched via API (with the same data restrictions).
The REST API is intended to be used for integrating with other web applications, but can also be used directly. JSON format is used by the API as the output format.

##API URL and interactive documentation

To access the API, the API Key is needed. Users can also use the API with their Monitor your satellites credentials.
API can be accessed in Swagger/OpenAPI tool: [https://api.monitor-your-satellites.service.gov.uk/docs](https://api.monitor-your-satellites.service.gov.uk/docs)

There’s also a ReDOC version of the documentation (easier to read but not interactive): [https://api.monitor-your-satellites.service.gov.uk/redoc](https://api.monitor-your-satellites.service.gov.uk/redoc)

##Authentication
Go to [https://www.monitor-your-satellites.service.gov.uk/account/credentials](https://www.monitor-your-satellites.service.gov.uk/account/credentials) to generate your user credentials (`client_id` and `client_secret`) which you can exchange for the Bearer token by sending following request:

```
curl --request POST \
  --url https://monitor-your-satellites.eu.auth0.com/oauth/token \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"client_id":"...","client_secret":"...","audience":"monitor-your-satellites.service.gov.uk/api","grant_type":"client_credentials"}'
```

This request will return a response in the following format:

```
{
      "access_token": "eyJ…qWZdPAc80Q",
      "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

The `access_token` value should be used to authorise requests to protected endpoints. If using the Swagger/OpenAPI tool: [https://api.monitor-your-satellites.service.gov.uk/docs](https://api.monitor-your-satellites.service.gov.uk/docs) then you should insert the bearer token in the `APIKeyHeader (apiKey)` value field in the Authorize popup in the format `Bearer eyJ…qWZdPAc80Q`.

##API methods
The API methods are documented using OpenAPI and can be seen and tried out using the interface below.

<div class="govuk-warning-text">
  <span class="govuk-warning-text__icon" aria-hidden="true">!</span>
  <strong class="govuk-warning-text__text">
    <span class="govuk-warning-text__assistive">Please note</span>
     Interacting with the API using the interface below will create real API calls.
