# How to use the API

##Purpose

Monitor my satellites exposes the REST API for gathering all the data available via the application frontend. The same content can be fetched via API (with the same data restrictions).
REST API is intended to be used for integrating with other web applications, but can also be used directly. JSON format is used by the API as the output format.

##API URL and interactive documentation

To access the API, the API Key is needed. Users can also use the API with their Monitor my satellites credentials.
API can be accessed in Swagger/OpenAPI tool: https://api.monitor-my-satellites.space/docs

There’s also a ReDOC version of the documentation (easier to read but not interactive):
https://api.monitor-my-satellites.space/redoc

##Authentication
Users can authenticate using a simple cURL script:

```
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://monitor-your-satellites-dev.eu.auth0.com/oauth/token' \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"grant_type":"password", "client_id":"z5NUc3MYN12niRPwMDXmjkELiwuJGQ1u", "client_secret":"SlRPKWBPYpOuDS5GmwHAqDe9IEuUJq1nvzHKrBiJPZhqG8qOQyS-QKHNf-1U8yGo",
"password":"xxxxxxxxxxxxx",
"username":"xxxxx@xxxxx", "audience":"dev.monitor-your-satellites.service.gov.uk/api", "scope":"openid email profile"}'
```

This script should produce a JSON output, where access_token value should be used to authorize (“Authorize” in OpenAPI web interface).

##API methods

API was divided into following parts:

* Events
* Satellites
* CDMs
* Analyses
* Ephemeris
* Users
* Statistics

###Events
Provides information about Events created from SpaceTrack CDMs.

`GET /v1/events/`

Provides a list of events with metadata (userInterest column). Basically it’s presented in the frontend Events page. It’s useful when the user needs to look at the past events or tries to find events specific to a single satellite. It’s possible to search with LIKE pattern (ie. when looking for all satellites matching some pattern in their names). It’s also possible to find events with the biggest probability of collision or the lowest miss distance.

`GET /v1/events/{event_id}/summary`

Gets basic information about the event with provided short ID (in the format of bmqvgb-kkjodz-pgnnc). It’s useful when a user searches for SpaceTrack’s CDM ID.

`GET /v1/events/{event_id}/data-sources`

Provides the newest SpaceTrack CDM and UKSA Analysis (if applicable) for a given event.

`GET /v1/events/{cdm_external_id}`

Gets series of events where one of these events was built upon a given SpaceTrack CDM. Events can be then sorted by CDM IDs to obtain other CDMs and check SpaceTrack source.

###Satellites

Gives access to satellite data

`GET /v1/satellites/with-metadata`

Returns a detailed list of satellites. Provides ability to search with simple text search to find groups of satellites matching the same pattern.

`GET /v1/satellites/{norad_id}`

Provides detailed information about a single satellite and its organization.

`PATCH /v1/satellites/{satellite_id}`

Allows to update satellite information. Internal database satellite ID is required to do so. Only available to ADMINs.

###CDMs
Provides some information about imported SpaceTrack CDMs. Currently only one method is available for users.

`GET /v1/cdms/latest`

Gives the CDM ID and date/time of the last ingested SpaceTrack CDM. Useful for checking if the ingestion process is alive and SpaceTrack is properly responding.

###Analyses

Allows Orbital Analysts to upload and delete their analyses, Operators to get analyses for their own satellites.

`GET /v1/analyses/`
Get a full list of uploaded analyses. The list may be sorted by users who uploaded, deleted or restored analyses. It’s also useful when sorted by collision probability or miss distances to check for erroneous uploads.

`POST /v1/analyses/`

Allows upload of a single or list of analyses. It’s possible to upload analyses matching the same event short ID.

`GET /v1/analyses/{analysis_id}`

Gets detailed information about a single analysis. Internal analysis database ID is required to fetch the data.

`DELETE /v1/analyses/{analysis_id}`

Gives ability to soft-delete the uploaded analysis. The data is not entirely deleted, it’s marked as inactive (not showing in frontend) but still accessible for monitoring and audit purposes. Soft deletion gives the possibility to restore the analysis in the future. Internal analysis database ID is required to fetch the data.

###Ephemeris
Operators can use this part to upload detailed satellite ephemeris data (the precise position of their satellites in space). This information can be used by Orbital Analysts or other Operators.

`GET /v1/ephemeris/{ephemeris_id}`

Gets the ephemeris file copy identical to the original upload. Internal database ID is required to get the file. The response is the text file in key-value .oem format. Filename is created after the CREATION_DATE from the ephemeris file to avoid accidental overwrites when similarly named files would be downloaded.

`GET /v1/ephemeris/`

Provides a list of uploaded ephemeris files. The list can be sorted by organizations that own satellites or by satellite name.

`POST /v1/ephemeris/`

Allows OPERATORs to upload their ephemeris files. Ephemeris files have to be named in a special way according to SpaceTrack standards, they have to include satellite NORAD ID. Otherwise they would be rejected. They also have to be in line with the .oem file format guidelines. More information can be found here:
https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/502x0b2c1e2.pdf - OEM file format definition
https://www.space-track.org/documents/Spaceflight_Safety_Handbook_for_Operators.pdf - file naming convention from SpaceTrack Handbook for Operators (page 23)

###Users
Provides basic information about the current user.

`GET /users/me`

Gets full user information (notification settings and thresholds, personal information)

`PATCH /users/me`

Allows modifying user information (settings, personal information and password)

###Statistics
Summary statistics with the number of objects in database

`GET /stats`

Gives simple statistics: the number of CDMs, Events, Satellites, Analyses and Ephemeris files in the database.
