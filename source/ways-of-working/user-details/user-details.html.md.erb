# How to create and amend user details

### Purpose
With Monitor Space Hazards currently in the public beta phase, this involves the addition of new users and user groups. Therefore, it is essential to have a clear process outlined for the creation of new user accounts and for how usersâ€™ details can be amended or deleted.

### Adding users on Monitor Space Hazards
Super Users and Admins can manage user details on the frontend through the Account menu.

If you have the correct permissions you will have the option to Add New User (to either your own or other Organisation depending on user role). The examples below show an admin adding a new user to their current organisation.
