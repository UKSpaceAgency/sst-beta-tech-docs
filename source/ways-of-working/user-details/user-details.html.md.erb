# How to create and amend user details

### Purpose
With Monitor Space Hazards currently in the public beta phase, this involves the addition of new users and user groups. Therefore, it is essential to have a clear process outlined for the creation of new user accounts and for how usersâ€™ details can be amended or deleted.

### Adding users on Monitor Space Hazards
Super Users and Admins can manage user details on the frontend through the Account menu.

If you have the correct permissions you will have the option to Add New User (to either your own or other Organisation depending on user role). The examples below show an admin adding a new user to their current organisation.

Once on the 'add new user page', you can fill in the new user details and confirm them, and this will send an email from Auth0 to the new user to set their password.

### Amending user details on Monitor Space Hazards
Once a user is created, their information can be viewed, along with all other registered users, on the Organisation page that the user is assigned to.

Registered users can subsequently be edited or deleted from their Organisation page.
