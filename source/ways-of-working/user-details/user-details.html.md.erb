In the next few weeks, we are hoping to introduce self-serving processes in which admins are able to add users to Mys, which will automatically create a user in Auth0. Admins will also be able to change user details and delete users from their Mys account.

### Purpose
With Monitor your satellites (Mys) moving into the public beta phase, this will involve the addition of new users and user groups. Therefore, it is essential to have a clear process outlined for the creation of new user accounts and for how users’ details can be amended or deleted.

## Processes

### Adding a new user
1.  Access the database using GOV.UK PaaS and your GOV.UK PaaS credentials
1.  Run `cf env mys-db-dev`​ (change app name as appropriate) to output the environment variables
1.  From `VCAP_SERVICES` read the Postgres​ section for `"credentials"`​and use to access the database
1. Navigate to Monitor your satellites database users table, where you are able to see all users on the application
1. Add row to the bottom of the table and fill in required columns
  * Terms and conditions, gdpr and `account_details_confirmed_at` columns are left empty (as user needs to accept these when they first access the site)
  * Enter true into the active column: true is for active users, false is for inactive
  * Leave the ‘is verified column’ blank until user has verified email address (via Auth0)
  * Leave settings blank so user can choose own account settings when they enter the site
1. Access Auth0 console using your credentials
  * Go to dashboard (need to be an admin in order to do this)
  * Choose correct tenant (prod)
  * Go to user management
  * Go to users
  * Click create user and fill in necessary information
  * Have to fill in a password, user will change this when they receive an email from Auth0 asking them to do so
  * Choose username-password authentication

       Database access will be provided to UKSA and/or suppliers offline as required on a principle of least privilege basis.

### Amending user details
* There are no actions to take in Auth0 as password only needs to be set up on creation of user account
* Go to database and either create an update query or use GUI to change the user

### Deleting a user
* Deleting a user on Auth0 would be enough to stop a user having access to the Mys site (make them inactive on the user database)
* But should also delete the user from the Mys database

### User permissions
* The different user types will have the following permissions granted (to interact with the API)

### Using the web interface
Super Users and Admins can also manage user details on the frontend through the Account menu.

If you have the correct permissions you will have the option to Add New User (to either your own or other Organisation depending on user role).

![Account information link to add new user](images/account-information.png)

Fill in the details, confirm and an email with be triggered from Auth0 to the new user to set their password. 

![New user creation form](images/add-user-form.png)

Once the user is created, their information can be editted or deleted from the Organisation page that the user is assigned to.
