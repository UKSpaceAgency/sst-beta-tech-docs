# How to manage ephemeris

# Uploading/submitting OEM Ephemeris data

**Definition**

*An OEM specifies the position and velocity of a single object at multiple epochs contained within a specified time range. The OEM is suited to exchanges that (1) involve automated interaction (e.g., computer-to-computer communication where frequent, fast automated time interpretation and processing is required), and (2) require higher fidelity or higher precision dynamic modeling than is possible with the OPM.*

Monitor space hazards uses Ephemeris files in .oem format to exchange data from satellite operators to UKSA orbital analysts. 

The format of .oem file can be found here: https://public.ccsds.org/Pubs/502x0b2c1e2.pdf

Because of some differences between the .oem format and the way Monitor space hazards handles satellite data, Ephemeris files have to be constructed with one thing in mind: the proper file name. Due to the fact that .oem files have different satellite names than SpaceTrack can provide, the satellite descriptor - NORAD ID has to be encoded in the .oem file. This is aligned with the SpaceTrack requirements on naming Ephemeris files and described in SpaceTrack Handbook for Operators (page 23):

https://www.space-track.org/documents/Spaceflight_Safety_Handbook_for_Operators.pdf

The format of a filename is as follows:

`<DataType>_<SatelliteNumber#>_<CommonName>_<DayTimeGroup>_<Operational/Special>_<MetaData>_<Classification>.<FileExtension>`

Examples:

- MEME_25544_ISS_1651200_oper__unclassified.txt
- MEME_25544_ISS(ZARYA)_1651200_operational_nomnvr_UNCLASSIFIED.txt
- MEME_25544_ISS_1651200_special_mnvr01_Unclassified.txt
- MEME_UCN01_SPACESAT1_1651200_special_burn01_Unclassified.txt
- MEME_799500234_Sat1_1651200_special_separation_unclassified.txt

**Monitor space hazards** expects the filename to contain the NORAD ID and when itâ€™s not found either in filename or in the **Monitor space hazards** database, the file cannot be uploaded.

**Monitor space hazards** also checks the contents of the .oem file which has to be in line with the .oem file specification. Fields that are validated against the specification are:

- NORAD ID must be provided in filename (as above explained)
- NORAD ID must match the current page satellite NORAD ID 
- Satellite with provided NORAD ID must be in **Monitor space hazards** database
- META_START/META_STOP tags must be in ephemeris file in header section in proper order (START before STOP)

**Following fields must be present in ephemeris file:**

- ORIGINATOR
- OBJECT_NAME
- OBJECT_ID
- REF_FRAME
- TIME_SYSTEM
- START_TIME
- STOP_TIME
- CENTER_NAME
- CCSDS_OEM_VERS
- CREATION_DATE

Ephemeris files can be uploaded directly in **Monitor space hazards** application in the Satellites section or via API using POST /ephemeris endpoint (when object_id and .oem file must be provided).
