# Joiners, Movers and Leavers

The Service Team has a joiners and leavers process for accessing Manage my Satellites (MMS).

### Joiners
* When a new team member joins accounts are created and/or invitations sent for:
 * Jira - used to track what we are working option
 * GitHub repos - all our repos are public
 * GOV.UK Notify - in order to amend and send notifications via the MMS services
 * Piwik - for web analytics
 * MMS Dev and MMS Prod to become a registered user and access the service
 * Google Drive - for collaboration and documentation storage
 * Sentry, Logit.io and Let's Encrypt access will be given on a needs basis

### Movers and leavers
* If a team member leaves, permissions and accounts are revoked to prevent access to services, private repos and systems.
