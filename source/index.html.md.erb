# About

The UK Space Agency are building a web application for space surveillance and tracking to monitor satellites
and alert operators about risks. This is a key building block in the UKâ€™s plan to lead the way in promoting
long term sustainable space activities. The increasing complexity of space missions, the emergence of large
constellations of satellites and the increased risks of collision all affect this long-term sustainability.

This is the Technical Documentation supporting the Beta phase of the Monitor My Satellites service. It utilises
the [Tech Docs Template] in the [GitHub Tech Docs Code].

The Service Team have decided to use the [C4 Model] to visualise the architecture for the service,
[Architecture Decision Records] (ADRs) are also used to record key decisions, and [Design Docs] for larger design
articulations that require broader consensus beyond just the technical team. The Team are also ensuring the project adheres to Government Service Standards by compiling a [Government Digital Service Standards Wiki] (https://sst-tech-docs.london.cloudapps.digital/gdswiki/).
